        "heading": "The Photovoltaic Process",
        "content": "Each photovoltaic cell is basically a sandwich made up of two slices of semi-conducting material, usually silicon. To work, photovoltaic cells need to establish an electric field, similar to a magnetic field, which occurs when opposite poles are separated."

      {
        "heading": "From Panels to Power",
        "content": "When the photovoltaic cell is exposed to sunlight, the energy from the sun knocks electrons loose, allowing them to flow freely. The electric field in the cell forces these free electrons to flow in a certain direction, creating a current. This current, together with the cell's voltage (which is a result of its built-in electric field), defines the power (or wattage) that the solar cell can produce."

        "heading": "The Complete System",
        "content": "From there, metal conductive plates on the sides of the cell collect the electrons and transfer them to wires. At that point, the electrons can flow like any other source of electricity. Inverters then convert the electricity from DC (direct current) to AC (alternating current), which is used to power buildings."
